cs2303 project 1

My program will ask you how many sets of coordinates you have then create a for loop the size that was stated. each set of coordinates will be enetered individually and the program will use an acumulator variable to add up all the distances. Afterwards it will divide the sum by the number of pairs stated to get the average, which it will then pass to the log function which will then pass the answer to the graph function to create a bar graph. 

To compile:
gcc proj1.c -o a -lm

After compiling:
./a
